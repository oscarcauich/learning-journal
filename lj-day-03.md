# First Learning Journal - Day 03

Today was an interesting day.  We were introduced to loops and Arrays. Today was the first day that I had to use my brain to complete the lab. I had a hard time wrapping my head around the lab project, which is kind of interesting because I'm familiar with loops and arrays but at first I just couldn't get the loop to do what I wanted it to do, but as everything in programming you just need to be persistent. I really enjoyed today's lab.  

We also learned how to create and switch to a new Github branch. It is important to work out of git branches rather than working directly with the master branch. We were also told how to create a pull request form with Github and how to merge one branch to the master branch.  

We kept on learning CSS, key concepts introduced today were, padding, borders, margins, inline and block.  

I hope everyday is like today, programming Rocks!
