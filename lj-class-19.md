#Learning Journal - Class 19

Thursday was filled with a lot of stress. It seems that everytime we do a merge to master, no matter how good we think we resolved the conflicts the code would break. But with code everything has a solution and if we work together we can solve anything and that is what we did, we worked as a team and fixed all the issues we had. I'm super excited to precent our project I feel that we accomplish what we wanted.  

I'm happy with how quick I can write js functions now, they've become second nature to me. I know that if I continue to practice more I can make writing js code easier and faster.
