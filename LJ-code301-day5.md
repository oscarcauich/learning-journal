# LJ Code 301 - Day 3

Day three already, I'm feeling good so far. The labs haven't been that difficult and something we've hit so wall but nothing we haven't been able to figure out. jQuery does make your code smaller but it doesn't have its learning curb, is not as easy to fully understand. But I know I just need to practice more and more and I know eventually it will just click.  

The most difficult part of working with jQuery for me is to understand how it handles bubbling. When we add just handlers you need to understand how it listens to the particular even and how it affects its siblings, children, parents, etc. I will conquer jQuery soon.
