#Learning Journal - Day 13

Today we were given a problem we needed to solved using what we already learned in the last two weeks and for some reason I felt like I got stuck and couldn't figure out how to solve the problem. I don't really know why I can't seem to find the answer to the problem and no matter I tried it just didn't work.  

Overall I feel like I understand javascript how it works and stuff but I can't or don't know how to implement what I have learned to solve a problem. I wonder if this is normal, but in the process of figuring this out, it is really frustrating.
