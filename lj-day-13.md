#Learning Journal - Day 15

Alright finally I was able to overcome my road blocks and get busmall working. It took me a really long time to figure out the solution. I read a ton of articles, watched a lot of videos, but I was able to get it working. From what I heard during the 401 teacher's conversation, this is a normal day for a software developer. What I learn from this lab specifically is that no matter how difficult or frustrating a problem might be, there is always a way to solve it, we just how to learning to search for the solution.  

I'm eager to start the next day and get a new challenge, from the article that I read this is how we grow technically and mentally. We have to push ourselves to be better, to be the best. If we get too comfortable we will stay in the same place, the best developers are the ones the push themselves out of their comfort zones, and I want to be that developer.
