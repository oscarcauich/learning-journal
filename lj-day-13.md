#Learning Journal - Day 17

Today was amazing day, I was assigned to work the the gamer pair project. The week kind of started rough since it took me a good couple days to get caught up with the busmall project. But as always we need to keep trying and eventually we will see the light at the end of the tunnel.  

Today during class I was a bit lost with javascript inheritance, honestly it doest look a bit more complicated than PHP's inheritance, but I guess it is just practice. At the end of week three I do feel really good with the amount of concepts I've learned. I totally looking forward for next week to start writing some JS code.
