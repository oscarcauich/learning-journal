#Learning Journal - Class 18

Today was a lot of code polishing, debugging but we could finally see the light at the end of the tunnel. It is quite cool to see a project coming together and have 4 brains/ideas work on the same project at the same time and little conflicts. I'm really surprise on how git/gihub handles all the commits/changes nicely. Also, I finally fully understanding how git/github work. We were able to handle conflicts like a champ. Tomorrow we have a long day to do, but I'm sure we will finish on time.
