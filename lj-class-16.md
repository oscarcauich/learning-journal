#Learning Journal - Class 17

Today was day 2 of project week. Planning took a good chuck of coding time on Monday. But we manage to do a lot of coding yesterday. I personally worked on creating different functions, for taking user input from a form and input that data/values into localstorage to access later, a function to allow users to log in to the website. I worked on the landing page. I created different functions to dynamically generate html elements and render them into the landing page. I helped Adan with the registration form.  

I'm super happy with the features that we've coded already and looking forward for tomorrow to keep coding.
