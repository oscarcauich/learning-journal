# LJ Code 301 - Day 8


Today we learned how to setup our node.js server environment to handle SQL query requests. It seems a bit complex to set it up especially to setup your routes for each of the SQL queries (CRUD). Luckily I'm using a mac system, apparently to set up postgress to handle query request form the node.js environment using a linux system it is a more complex process. After I successfully setup my postgress environment today, I played around with postgress, it seems like the syntax to manipulate data inside postgress is pretty simple. I'm hoping that everything else this simple, LOL.  

Changing subject, I've been enjoying codewars lately, I like the challenges. I like that your brain is challenged to figure out how to solve a particular problem. I wish I have more time to do even more.
