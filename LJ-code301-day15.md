# LJ Code 301 - Day 15


Grand day has come, it is time for project week. I'm really excited to put together everything I've learned during the past three weeks. I feel confident with what I've learned and know up until this point. I already started working on a couple functions that we will used to gather current user's location and date which I already finished. I'm going to work on connecting with our API. It doesn't seems that difficult, I already connected with it on repl.it I just need to clean the data I get back and assign it probably to a variable object.   

I need to give myself a day to relax and not think about code, I went to sleep at 2am today which I guess is not good. So today is my day off.
