# LJ Code 301 - Day 6

Today we learned about Ajax and JSON. It seems pretty straight forward although I attempted to use Ajax with PHP before and I just couldn't get it to work. I didn't understand the syntax or something, at that time I just didn't understand what I was doing wrong. But After I completed the lab today I felt pretty good about working with Ajax.  

I also spent a good a mount of time doing some codewars challenges and I'm starting to develope an addiction to them. They are pretty nice, it forces your brain to think harder and outside the box. I'm looking forward to tomorrow's class.
