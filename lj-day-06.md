#Learning Journal - Day 08

Today we learned about Event, this one an easy chapter for me. I don't know  why but the lab was completed really quick, probably within an hour.  

Events are  actions that happened within the browser and we can use javascript to do something with it. We can check weather the user clicked on a button, submitted a form, etc with relying on a server doing all of these validations.

In order to code a script to do something with an event, we first create an Event listener which is waiting for the action(event) to happen, when that happens we call the event handler to run the code with in the function written for this event.
