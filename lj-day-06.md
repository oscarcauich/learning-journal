#Learning Journal - Day 06

Today was an intense day for me. I read the article about the problem domain and I totally agree with that article. Once I understand what the lab is asking us to code, then writing the code becomes kind of easy. But For some reason it takes me forever to fully understand what I need to code. I feel like I overthink the problem. I would like to focus more on understanding the bigger picture before I start to write any code.  

On the other hand we start looking at objects. How to create an object using the literal notation and construction notation. I'm familiar with this concept but javascript is a bit different. I'm not having a hard time wrapping my head around object I just feel I  need more practice for them to become a second nature.  

We also look in DOM. This is a new concept to me. But so far is not that difficult, I've seen it before working with PHP but I didn't really care much about it. It is a way to manipulate what the browser displays using javascript. That is it for today, hopefully tomorrow is easier on me.
