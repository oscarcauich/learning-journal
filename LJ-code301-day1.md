# LJ Code 301 - Day 1

Monday 5/8, first day of course 301. For some reason when Sam was going over the class/course curriculum I felt a sense of nervousness. It seems like there are a lot of thing that we need to accomplish before the end of this course but I'm up to the challenge. The harder the challenge the greater the rewards.  

Today we also learn about media queries and how to start to think about making websites look good on mobile devices first and then make them respond to larger screens. The syntax seems straight forward and not to completed so far, hopefully it stays like this. I'm ready for tomorrow.
