# LJ Code 301 - Day 11


Today we finally had an easy day, lab was a blast, it took us about 45 minutes to complete it, which it gave me plenty of time to go over which assignments I needed to resubmit and resubmitted them. Making your apps spot(single page app) is fairly quick by taking advantage of page.js library. I'm amaze by the amount of libraries that are already built for JS and how easy it is to use them.  

One thing I'm still wrapping my head around is functional programming, it does makes sense once you start using it but to think about that concept during the planning face is not there yet for me. One thing I've found useful is to watch some youtube videos about the what were are going to see the following day in class and then review that same concept in youtube to solidify that concept. I would highly recommend watching some videos if something is not clear or if it doesn't make sense.
