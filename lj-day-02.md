# First Learning Journal - Day 02  

Today we learned how to use/navigate git thru the terminal. Git and Github are two different things. Git helps developers keep track of files over time. As best practice we should commit as often as possible. The more I use git thru the terminal, the easier it becomes, I'm actually starting to like it. The basic git commands are as follow:  

git Clone {URL} - This downloads  your git repositories  
git Add {file Name} - This command updates the index using the current content found in the working tree, to prepare the content staged for the next commit.  
git commit -m {'commit description'} - This stores the current contents of the index in a new commit along with a log message from the user describing the changes.  
git push {origin} + {master} - This updates remote refs using local refs, while sending objects necessary to complete the given refs.  

We were introduced a bit on CSS, learned how to properly link an external css file to our html page. We also learned linking external JS files in to our html files.
