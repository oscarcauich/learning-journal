# Learning Journal - Day 05

Today has been a really long day for me. The problems were a bit of a challenge but there is nothing more rewarding than working on a problem for hours and then finally getting it to work.  

Finally loops and functions are sticking in my head. The more I work with this concepts the easier they become. Also I feel a lot more comfortable working with git.  

One of the biggest challenges for me is to understand the question better. I solved all problems really quick but I solved them by using other techniques that made my solution incorrect.
