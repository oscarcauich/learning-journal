# LJ Code 301 - Day 5

On Day 5 we learning a bit about the trinary concept, pretty cool, I saw those lines on codes in the previous labs we've worked on but didn't really pay much attention to them. We also review most if not all of the concepts that we were introduced this week.  

I feel that doing code review and observing Sam doing the lab for today helped me a lot. It does make sense to me when someone tells the why behind why things are made that way. I feel better now, I feel like things are starting to click a bit more.
