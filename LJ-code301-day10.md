# LJ Code 301 - Day 10


Today was a tough day, callback functions do take a while to get used to. and on top of top, learning SQL syntax and then arrow style functions. Lab was a bit difficult today, for some reason my partner and I couldn't figure out how to use the array methods to get the data that we wanted. It does take a lot of reading and trial and error to get it working but we were able to figure it out. It is a good feeling to get something that you struggle a lot working, all the hard work and time spend researching at the end pays off.  

I'm going to focus on resubmitting all of my previous lab assignments to get my grade up again. I'm exited for next week, it looks like we are going to look into APIs. I will be spending a lot of time watching some youtube videos on working with APIs to get familiar with the concept.
